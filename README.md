### Meme Collecting

This is a web-scraping script for specific meme sub-categories and tags on KnowYourMeme.
It's still a work in progress!

The purpose of this script for me is to find specifically text-based memes for my senior thesis, to compile as a training set. For the training set, I am using only _confirmed_ memes.

I will later compile code for specific meme-archive blogs on tumblr, for the sake of having varied data; such as "but go off i guess" is still in submission form at KnowYourMeme, but it very clearly is a confirmed meme at least on tumblr.

#### To-Do
- Finish up the class for collecting entry information
- Implement Google Trends lookup, with [pytrends](https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/#caveats)
